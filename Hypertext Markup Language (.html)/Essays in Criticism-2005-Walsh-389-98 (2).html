This was in 1911, when Isaac Rosenberg was 20, and writing the dream: love, lips, eyes, pallor, seasons, moons, Junes and the occasional November, paradise, jewels, strife, God, also tresses and caresses, flowers and wine, beauty. Things are beamy and yes dreamy and dewy and divine; they blaze and whirl and burst and bind.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A shimmering rose coloured elegance Rose &amp; silver &amp; streaked</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With a tender blue of a luminous sky</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The warm lit fountain quivers in the lake The chequered green of emerald grass Shakes &amp; quivers &amp; throbs &amp; twinkles</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pearl and ruby abound as well, and especially gold; much is ‘golden’; one ‘naked day’ even goes ‘goldly’.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Then came August 1914 and, two summers later from the front line in France, when Rosenberg could see it fully for what it was, ‘August 1914’:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What in our lives is burnt In the fire of this?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The heart’s dear granary?

Such is Rosenberg as he comes down to us, filtered by anthologies and criticism, which see the pre-war writing as prologue, and by the earliest collections of his work, which put the war poetry first. Ian Parsons opted for a straight chrono- logy in his 1979 edition, but his dating is sometimes too sure, according to Vivien Noakes, and the volume as a whole is misleadingly tidy. Rosenberg’s pockets were often literally full of verse – the draft of a scene for a play, lines for different poems on the back of an envelope, a typescript on a sheet of creased, torn, cheap paper. It was his habit to write something and to plan and hope – when he escaped poverty, found work and so time and space, when he recovered his health, when he got back from the war – to return to it. Even his most accomplished verse was provisional. He is reported to have written a poem on lavatory paper during the war, though it has not, apparently, survived.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Everything of the poetry and plays that has survived appears in Noakes’s new volume, including all the variants and twice as many fragments as have been published before. Like Parsons, Noakes proceeds chronologically, but by being more tentative about it she keeps us from being hasty in our judgements of Rosenberg. Among the fragments appearing in print for the first time is ‘<i>The flowers I gather bloom with me / By </i>[<i>thought</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">| <i>meditation</i>] <i>fed’, </i>which Noakes says is probably from 1913. That sounds right – as does 1917 for <i>‘Yea I a soldier, say I have not suffered at all before / If this is suffering ’. </i>But Noakes finds <i>‘Like a voice compressed in a box / Coming out through a tiny crack</i>’ impossible to date, and she resists the temptation to place it with similiarly themed bits. These last lines may express Rosenberg’s experience of the confinement of the trenches and of what he considered to be the enslavement of soldiering. Perhaps the tiny crack opened on those rare occasions when, as he said in a letter from France, his company had ‘a bit of rest</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&amp; the others might be gambling or squabbling’; then he could</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘add a line or two’ and hope nothing  would  be  censored. Then again, the simile of the boxed voice may have expressed the desperation Rosenberg felt long before the war as a sickly, jobless, and isolated would-be artist.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Noakes sets right a number of misreadings from previous editions, always clearly explaining her reasons for doing so. A corpse lies in a ‘grave’ in ‘The Dead Past’ now, instead of a ‘grove’. ‘Time, leveller’ becomes ‘Time leveller’ to begin ‘To the Present’, for there is no evidence that Rosenberg wanted a comma, and the present really does have a way of levelling time. One can imagine why earlier editors saw ‘Wakes’ in the following from the first ‘Twilight’ (of three), but ‘Makes’ makes more sense: ‘The far adieu of the day as it touches the fingers of night, / Makes all to the eye and ear but seem wings spread for the soul for flight’. By careful cross-referencing, Noakes also shows how Rosenberg would incorporate earlier studies, whole poems and single lines and figures, into new poems, and then harvest bits of these for still later poems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">The comprehensiveness and transparency of <i>The Poems and Plays</i>, shaped as they are by Noakes’s combination of rigour and humility (a reluctance to pretend to the ‘definitive’), serve both to confirm and to complicate the critical commonplace that the war that killed Rosenberg made him as a poet. The ‘demons gurgling over me’ in 1912 are leaves from some strange imagined tree; five years later, in the trenches, it is the lice that rage ‘like a demons’ pantomime’. Is it Rosenberg’s fault that we find the former much less convincing? Partly. The earlier image strains for effect; the latter simply achieves it. Partly, though, we must admit, the fault is ours, or history’s. The cataclysm of the Great War concentrates our minds; the hard and cold entrance us. Yet the continuities in Rosenberg’s poetry prove to be as substantial as the changes, and ponder- ing them helps us better appreciate his accomplishments as a whole. Working as he did – ‘modelling’ with language, Denys Harding said – helped Rosenberg produce a coherent and substantial body of work despite the scant opportunity  his short life afforded him.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Rosenberg’s habit of ‘Dreaming in grandeurs of superb light and deep shadow’, as Siegfried Sassoon put it, had its dangers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Some early lines read like overheated Poe or Keats. ‘The world rumbles by me – can I heed? / The rose it is crimson – and I bleed’. From early on, however, Rosenberg checked or assim- ilated his penchant for grandeur by seeking not just to reconcile extremes but to see them within each other, to marry them as his hero Blake did. He was as earthy as he was ‘skiey’: ‘The roots of our eternal souls were fed / On the world’s dung and now their blossoms gleam’. The extended ‘<span class="s3">ARGUMENT</span>’ in ‘Night and Day’ shows how unproverbially alike ‘night and day’ actually are. ‘Summer in Winter’, ‘Midsummer Frost’, and ‘Dawn behind Night’ make similar turns. The trick for this painter-poet was to  mix the disparate  colours without compromising their distinct integrities. This would be fine excess, a road to wisdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">It was a road that required vigilance and dedication. ‘In the Workshop’, published as a poem in itself in an obscure 1912 booklet but not in any Rosenberg collection until Noakes’s, succeeds as a still-life indictment of the absence of such virtues:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Dim, watery lights on gibbering faces. Faces speechful, barren of soul, and sordid.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Huddled and chewing a jest, lewd, and gabbled insidious; Laughter born of its dung, flashes and floods, like sunlight, Filling  the  room  with  a  sense  of  a  soul  lethargic  and</p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">kindly,</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Touches my soul with a pathos, a hint of wide desolation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Intimations of transcendence illuminate the gossipy compla- cency, and not in a flattering way. What waste! the poet seems to say. Repunctuated and folded into ‘Night and Day’, these lines follow a question – ‘Shall I turn me to this tavern / And so rest me from the sultriness?’ – that frames the passage in a humour of self-implication. One could use a drink, Rosenberg admits. But as he wrote elsewhere, ‘Art is not a play thing, it is blood and tears’.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">He would not rest, not in ‘Night and Day’, nor in his life. His obvious romanticism helps to explain why, but only when coupled with his Judaism. T. S. Eliot praised Rosenberg for being distinctively Hebraic: one couldn’t pinpoint what was essentially  Jewish  (any  more  than  one  could  say  exactly</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">what made Whitman so American), but such things are most ‘effectually expressed through rhythm’. So said Eliot. I think that this religious matter is instead most effectually expressed through religious convictions, convictions that gave Rosenberg’s artistic energy and steadfastness their deepest roots.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘The Jew’ is a powerfully bitter poem:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moses, from whose loins I sprung Lit by a lamp in his blood</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ten immutable rules, a moon For mutable lampless men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The blonde, the bronze, the ruddy, With the same heaving blood, Keep tide to the moon of Moses, Then why do they sneer at me?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is also an essentially reactionary one, a sneer for a sneer; yet Rosenberg’s Judaism was usually and forcefully generative. His play <i>Moses </i>is a study in power fledging. ‘I am rough now, and new’, says Moses, ‘and will have no tailor’. Compared to his Christian countrymen, who had a saviour between them and the calamities of the Old Testament, Rosenberg felt close to exile (his parents had fled the growing anti-Semitism in Lithuania) and to exodus. This feeling resulted not in despair but in stubborn hope, in a sense of responsibility or mission that was kabbalistic  in  its  emphasis  on  an  oral  connection to creation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mortals – ancient syllables Spoken of God’s mouth, – Do spirits them chronicle So they be not lost?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Surely the speech of God’s mouth Shall not be for nought!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the early ‘A Ballad of Whitechapel’, his assertion that ‘God’s mercy shines, / And our full hearts must make a record of this’ helps us to understand his promise from the front that ‘this war, with all its powers of devastation, shall not master</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">my poeting’. It also helps us understand how he managed to keep this promise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Noakes’s ‘general policy of non-interference’ in editorial matters is wise, but in ‘A Ballad of Whitechapel’ she gives us ‘What fearful land have my steps wandered to?’ instead of Rosenberg’s typescript version, ‘What fearful land has my steps wandered to?’, thereby depriving us of the fleeting suggestions that the land indeed possesses our steps and that steps taken constitute a singularity, any number  of  roads  not  taken. But Parsons, Gordon Bottomley (1922), and Harding (1937, nominally with Bottomley) made the same change Noakes did; perhaps my non-interference goes too far.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">One place I would have interfered where Parsons and Noakes did not is in the first stanza of ‘On Receiving News of the War: Capetown’:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Snow is a strange white word. No ice or frost</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Have asked of bud or bird For Winter’s cost.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Neither editor saw fit to follow Bottomley in changing ‘Have’ to ‘Has’. Parsons wanted to ‘avoid a double “s’’’ and Noakes wanted to avoid ‘distorting the sibilant quality, and hence the rhythm, of the lines’. What would Rosenberg have done had he the chance? We cannot say for sure, but pondering the question</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">– and this is what a fine scholarly edition leads us to do – enlarges our appreciation of the poem. ‘No ice or frost / <i>Has </i>asked of bud or bird’ might enhance the sibilance; it certainly drums up the rhythm with an internal rhyme. Also, the z-sound of ‘has’ picks up the same sound in ‘is’ in the first line, a sound that grows louder through the next three stanzas of the poem. Unlike the s-sound, the z requires the vocal cords to absorb breath, much as the poem seeks to absorb the strange news of far-off war. ‘No man knows why’ war comes, the second stanza concludes, but as the third asserts, ‘In all men’s hearts it is’. The fourth stanza positively buzzes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Red fangs have torn His face. God’s blood is shed.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He mourns from His lone place His children dead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All this horror is his and ours. We feel it like a burr in the throat. Then, a departure. The final stanza holds out a glisten- ing hope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">O! ancient crimson curse! Corrode, consume.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Give back this universe Its pristine bloom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">My zeal for z’s may be too much, but their earlier preponder- ance makes this last stanza, free of them after the opening bloodletting of ‘crimson’, slide out all the more easily – a kind of whistling in the dark.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">The idea that war would improve individual and collective human character was not unusual, and in 1914, from South Africa, it must have had a powerful appeal. We – I suppose I mean students especially – tend now to think of war poets since the Great War as uniformly and necessarily anti-war poets. Rosenberg did hate war, but he also wrote poetry that might have pleased the War Office. The sardonic ‘To Wilhelm II’ expresses great contempt for the enemy and even greater pride in the English.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is cruel for you Emperor The sea has a stone,</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">England – they call it England, That cannot shine in your crown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This was ‘doggrel’ according to Rosenberg himself, but it strikes me as too hearty and convincing in its sentiments to have been entirely put on. ‘Pozières’ begins,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glory! glory! glory!</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">British women! in your wombs you plotted</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This monstrous girth of glory, this marvellous glory.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not for mere love-delights Time meant the profound hour When an Englishman was planned.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Here again the idea of war as necessary for the English to bloom was written not from the antipodes at war’s beginning but from the Somme in 1916, in the middle of a long and terrible battle. Rosenberg called it ‘a patriotic gush a jingo spasm’ and entered it into the Division Christmas card contest. (It did not win.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: right;">The point is not that Rosenberg was a warmonger, but that he sought to express everything war engendered in him. As he wrote from the front, ‘I will not leave a corner of my consciousness covered up, but saturate myself with the strange and extraordinary new conditions of this life, and it will refine itself into poetry later on’. Like Whitman, the author of the war poem he admired most (‘Beat! Beat! Drums!’), Rosenberg contained multitudes, including the occasional ardent warrior. The critics are divided on whether Rosenberg was ironic or not. It seems to me that his Whitmanian project required him to subsume irony, to include but go beyond it. Consider ‘Break of Day in the Trenches’, the poem Paul Fussell calls the greatest of the Great War. Rosenberg’s revisions help us see, though, that the poem does not fit Fussell’s ironic pattern, which requires first that innocence should fuel hope, and then that hope be dashed. The poem reverses this course. Hopes are dashed in the beginning, with a dawn that ‘crumbles away’ the sheltering dark; light will bring danger. Then a ‘droll rat’ leaps the narrator’s hand as he sticks a poppy behind his ear. He remarks  the  rat’s  ‘cosmopolitan  sympathies’.  ‘(And  God knows what antipathies)’ Rosenberg added parenthetically, and was wise to strike out, for this needs to be a comic, but not a jocular, moment. After ‘What do you see in our eyes’ he also deleted ‘At the boom, the hiss, the swiftness, / the irrevocable earth-buffet . . . / What rootless poppies dropping’. The first line is terrifyingly lovely, snaking in like a shell, but ‘irrevocable’ sounds too abstract, and ‘rootless poppies’ too</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">despairing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The roots do come, slowly. A second typescript gives ‘Poppies whose roots are in the veins’; in the final version, they find their particular place:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">What do you see in our eyes  At the shrieking iron and flame</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hurl’d through still heavens? What quaver – what heart aghast?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Poppies whose roots are in man’s veins Drop, and are ever dropping,</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But mine in my ear is safe – Just a little white with the dust.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In man’s veins, in man, the poppies root. It is tragic that they drop; that they are ‘ever dropping’ evokes the slaughter of the war – but it also suggests a cycle of natural renewal, an idea that prepares the ground for the macabre playfulness of the very last lines. The dust must be from the trenches, perhaps thrown up by a shell, the same dust that fell from the tattered papers Noakes sorted through for us. It puts Fussell in mind of the ‘Dust’ that ‘hath closed Helen’s eye’ in Thomas Nashe’s ‘In Time of Pestilence’. It is the dust from which we came, and to which we shall return. But the matter does not end there, for from that ‘<i>slow dust</i>’, as Rosenberg has it in a fragment, ‘<i>God kneads his changing forms / Sculptor of </i>{<i>exhaustless </i>| <i>infinite</i>} <i>dreams we thank our dreamer</i>’. Fussell may be right that the assertion of safety at the end of ‘Break of Day in the Trenches’ is the poem’s most ironic point, but it is also its dreamiest. The poem generates an innocence and a hope that keep springing just beyond irony’s reach.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Rosenberg can have it this way without diminishing the suffering he endured and witnessed, and expressed most affectingly in a fragment from another fragment:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And we have suf</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One can imagine his comrades-in-arms turning from their squabbling or gambling to  interrupt, perhaps to harass Rosenberg as he was composing this line. He was too busy suf- fering to write about it. But let his last poem, something more than a fragment, something he was able to conclude and send to a friend with apologies (‘just a slight thing’) as was his wont, be the last word. It is a poem that is hard and cold, but not only that.
