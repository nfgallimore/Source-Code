    pound fresh phyllo pastry sheets or frozen, thawed<BR>4 1/2 tablespoons 
    chopped fresh rosemary<BR>
    <P>1 32- to 36-ounce wheel of Brie<BR>
    <P><B>Presentation</B><BR>Fresh herb sprigs (such as rosemary, sage,a and 
    chives)<BR>Additional dried apricots and dried cherries<BR>Fresh baguettes, 
    thinly sliced<BR>Thinly sliced apples 
    <P><B>To Make Chutney</B><BR>Combine all ingredients except almonds in heavy 
    large saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar 
    dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until most liquid has 
    evaporated and chutney is thick, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. 
    Mix in almonds. Transfer chutney to bowl. 
    <P>Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover, keep 
    chilled.) 
    <P><B>Assembly of cheese and phyllo</B><BR>Brush heavy large baking sheet 
    with butter; set aside. Unroll pastry. Cover with plastic wrap and damp 
    kitchen towel. Transfer 2 stacked phyllo sheets to work surface, arranging 1 
    short side parallel to edge of work surface. Arrange 2 more stacked phyllo 
    sheets on work surface, overlapping long side of first sheets by about 5 to 
    7 inches and forming rectangle about 18 by 17 inches. Brush pastry with 
    butter; sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons rosemary over. Place 2 more stacked 
    sheets atop first set of 2 sheets, then 2 more stacked sheets atop second 
    set of 2 sheets. Brush with butter and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons 
    rosemary. Repeat layering 1 more time with phyllo, butter and 1 1/2 
    tablespoons rosemary. (You will use a total of 12 sheets.) 
    <P>Using sharp knife or scissors, trim phyllo corners, forming approximately 
    17-inch oval. place Brie in center of phyllo. Spread 1 1/2 cups chutney 
    evenly over cheese. Slide hand under 1 rounded corner of phyllo. Lift phyllo 
    and fold onto top of cheese. Brush folded pastry with butter. Continue to 
    lift phyllo in sections and to fold snugly over top of cheese, brushing with 
    butter and pressing each section to adhere until cheese is wrapped (the top 
    center 2 to 3 inches of cheese will not be covered). Use hand and metal 
    spatula to transfer wrapped cheese to prepared baking sheet. 
    <P>Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface. Brush with butter. Starting at 1 
    long side, fold 1 inch of pastry over. Continue folding pastry loosely over 
    itself, forming 1-inch-wide strip of pastry over. Continue folding pastry 
    loosely over itself, forming 1-inch-wide strip of pastry. Roll up strip into 
    coil. Gather bottom edge of coil together, pinching to force top slightly 
    open and forming rose. Place rose atop uncovered center of cheese. Brush 
    with butter. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, forming 2 more roses. 
    Place atop cheese, covering opening completely. Chill 3 hours. (Can be made 
    1 day ahead. Cover with plastic; keep chilled.) 
    <P>Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Bake cheese until 
    pastry is deep golden brown, covering roses loosely with foil if browning 
    too quickly, about 25 minutes. (If cheese leaks from pastry during baking, 
    press piece of foil over tear in pastry; continue baking.) 
    <P>Cool cheese on sheet 45 minutes. 
    <P><B>Presentation</B><BR>Using metal spatula, transfer warm cheese to large 
    platter. Arrange herbs, dried fruit, baguette slices and apple slices around 
    cheese. Cut cheese into wedges.
